//
// Reference configuration for metrics filters with default values.
//
// - Metrics are organized to a tree structure that may split on any level.
// - Root node is virtual and defines defaults that may be later overwritten on any level.
// - Branch nodes may be used to configure subtree of metrics, they may also hold metrics.
// - Leaf nodes are metrics like counters and timers.
// - Configurations from all levels are merged together, the most specific one wins.
// - Separator for metric names in this configuration is '.', separator used in code is implementation specific.
// - Each defined node must have boolean property "enabled".
// - The underlying format and parsing library is https://github.com/typesafehub/config.
